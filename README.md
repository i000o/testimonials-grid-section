## Lessons

1. Class cannot start with a digit
2. `src` for image, `href` for links!
3. `background-image`, `background-position-x`, `background-position-y`, `background-repeat` `background-attachment: scroll;`
4. It seems I do have to initiate Sass in the command line when I start a new session `sass --watch input.scss output.css`
5.
